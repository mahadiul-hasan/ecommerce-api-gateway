## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **scalable multivendor e-commerce platform** where vendors can register, list their products, manage orders, and receive payments â€” while customers can browse, search, purchase, and track products seamlessly.

The system will use a **microservices architecture**, ensuring scalability, fault isolation, and maintainability. Each service owns its own database and communicates through REST APIs and a message broker.

**Tech Stack Overview:**

-   **Backend:** Node.js (Express/NestJS) for all services, Go for Catalog Service
-   **Frontend:** Next.js (Customer Storefront), React.js (Vendor & Admin Dashboards)
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL + MongoDB
-   **Cache:** Redis
-   **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ
-   **Search:** Elasticsearch
-   **Media CDN:** Cloudinary
-   **Hosting:** Hostinger VPS

---

## 2. Objectives

-   Enable **multi-vendor selling** with separate shop management.
-   Provide **secure, fast, and intuitive shopping** for customers.
-   Use **microservices** for modular, scalable development.
-   Deliver **real-time updates** using message queues.
-   Provide **optimized image delivery** via Cloudinary CDN.
-   Support **powerful product search** with Elasticsearch.
-   Maintain **high uptime and observability** via logging, metrics, and tracing.

2. **Order Service** validates cart, reserves inventory.
3. Publishes `OrderCreated` event to **RabbitMQ**.
4. **Payment Service** listens â†’ processes payment â†’ emits `PaymentSuccess`.
5. **Inventory Service** confirms stock deduction.
6. **Notification Service** sends emails to vendor & customer.
7. **Vendor Dashboard** reflects new order in real time.
